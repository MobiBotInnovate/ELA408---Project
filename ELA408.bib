This study deals with the estimation of localizability, which indicates the reliability of localization at each location on the occupancy grid maps created by SLAM. There are several approaches to estimate localizability, this paper proposes a method using local map correlation. Our method represents the localizability using a covariance matrix of a Gaussian distribution, not just a scalar value. The simulation experiment results showed that the uncertainty of localizability increased at locations where degeneration is likely to occur, suggesting that localizability could be estimated appropriately.},

The experiment done by the mobile robot was equipped with a LIDAR sensor as a sensor for retrieving data around the robot where the robot was instructed to explore the corridor inside a building and do mapping in real time.

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose an optimization based SLAM approach to simultaneously optimize the robot trajectory and the occupancy map using 2D laser scans (and odometry) information. The key novelty is that the robot poses and the occupancy map are optimized together, which is significantly different from existing occupancy mapping strategies where the robot poses need to be obtained first before the map can be estimated. In our formulation, the map is represented as a continuous occupancy map where each 2D point in the environment has a corresponding evidence value. The Occupancy-SLAM problem is formulated as an optimization problem where the variables include all the robot poses and the occupancy values at the selected discrete grid cell nodes. We propose a variation of Gauss-Newton method to solve this new formulated problem, obtaining the optimized occupancy map and robot trajectory together with their uncertainties. Our algorithm is an offline approach since it is based on batch optimization and the number of variables involved is large. Evaluations using simulations and publicly available practical 2D laser datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach can estimate the maps and robot trajectories more accurately than the state-of-the-art techniques, when a relatively accurate initial guess is provided to our algorithm. The video shows the convergence process of the proposed OccupancySLAM and comparison of results to Cartographer can be found at https://youtu.be/4oLyVEUC4iY.},

This paper presents a practical occupancy grid-based method based on forward-looking sonar for AUV. The algorithm uses an extended Kalman filter (EKF) to estimate the AUV motion states. First, the SLAM method fuses the data coming from the navigation sensors to predict the motion states. Subsequently, a novel particle swarm optimization genetic algorithm (PSO-GA) scan matching method is employed for matching the sonar scan data and grid map, and the matching pose would be used to correct the prediction states. Lastly, the estimated motion states and sonar scan data would be used to update the grid map. The experimental results based on the field data have validated that the proposed SLAM algorithm is adaptable to underwater conditions, and accurate enough to use for ocean engineering practical applications.},

	abstract = {In scenarios with insufficient structural features, LiDAR-based SLAM may suffer from degeneracy, resulting in impaired robot localization and mapping and potentially leading to subsequent deviant navigation tasks. Therefore, it is crucial to develop advanced algorithms and techniques to mitigate the degeneracy issue and ensure the robustness and accuracy of LiDAR-based SLAM. This paper presents a LiDARâinertial simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) method based on a virtual inertial navigation system (VINS) to address the issue of degeneracy. We classified different gaits and match each gait to its corresponding torso inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor to construct virtual foot inertial navigation components. By combining an inertial navigation system (INS) with zero-velocity updates (ZUPTs), we formed the VINS to achieve real-time estimation and correction. Finally, the corrected pose estimation was input to the IMU odometry calculation procedure to further refine the localization and mapping results. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed VINS method in degenerate environments, we conducted experiments in three typical scenarios. The results demonstrate the high suitability and accuracy of the proposed method in degenerate scenes and show an improvement in the point clouds mapping effect. The algorithmâs versatility is emphasized by its wide applicability on GPU platforms, including quadruped robots and human wearable devices. This broader potential range of applications extends to other related fields such as autonomous driving.},

Several studies were conducted to improve the SLAM algorithm using various sensors and robot platforms. However, only a few works have focused on applications inside low-illuminated featureless tunnel environments. In this work, we present an improved SLAM algorithm using wheel encoder data from an autonomous ground vehicle (AGV) to obtain robust performance in a featureless tunnel environment. The improved SLAM system uses FAST-LIO2 LiDAR SLAM as the baseline algorithm, and the additional wheel encoder sensor data are integrated into the baseline SLAM structure using the extended Kalman filter (EKF) algorithm. The EKF algorithm is used after the LiDAR odometry estimation and before the mapping process of FAST-LIO2. The prediction step uses the wheel encoder and inertial measurement unit (IMU) data, while the correction step uses the FAST-LIO2 LiDAR state estimation. We used an AGV to conduct experiments in flat and inclined terrain sections in a tunnel environment. The results showed that the mapping and the localization process in the SLAM algorithm was greatly improved in a featureless tunnel environment considering both inclined and flat terrains.},

These sensors play a significant role in acquiring accurate environmental information for further processing and mapping. Therefore, understanding the operational limits of the available SLAM sensors and data collection techniques from a single sensor or multisensors is noteworthy.

	abstract = {The accelerated deployment of service robots have spawned a number of algorithm variations to better handle real-world conditions. Many local trajectory planning techniques have been deployed on practical robot systems successfully. While most formulations of Dynamic Window Approach and Model Predictive Control can progress along paths and optimize for additional criteria, the use of pure path tracking algorithms is still commonplace. Decades later, Pure Pursuit and its variants continues to be one of the most commonly utilized classes of local trajectory planners. However, few Pure Pursuit variants have been proposed with schema for variable linear velocities - they either assume a constant velocity or fails to address the point at all. This paper presents a variant of Pure Pursuit designed with additional heuristics to regulate linear velocities, built atop the existing Adaptive variant. The Regulated Pure Pursuit algorithm makes incremental improvements on state of the art by adjusting linear velocities with particular focus on safety in constrained and partially observable spaces commonly negotiated by deployed robots. We present experiments with the Regulated Pure Pursuit algorithm on industrial-grade service robots. We also provide a high-quality reference implementation that is freely included ROS 2 Nav2 framework at https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation2 for fast evaluation.},

Various navigation solutions have been proposed, though few as widely adopted as ROS (Robot Operating System) Navigation. 10 years on, it is still one of the most popular navigation solutions1. Yet, ROS Navigation has failed to keep up with modern trends. We propose the new navigation solution, Navigation2, which builds on the successful legacy of ROS Navigation. Navigation2 uses a behavior tree for navigator task orchestration and employs new methods designed for dynamic environments applicable to a wider variety of modern sensors. It is built on top of ROS2, a secure message passing framework suitable for safety critical applications and program lifecycle management. We present experiments in a campus setting utilizing Navigation2 to operate safely alongside students over a marathon as an extension of the experiment proposed in Eppstein et al. [1].

An inertial measurement unit (IMU), which is a set of sensors, plays an important role in mobile robotsâ navigation. Data collected by the IMU sensors on a robot are properly converted and useful information is calculated concerning, i.e., position, orientation, and acceleration. With the advancement of technology, IMUs have been transformed from large and complex devices into small, flexible, and efficient ones. The main sensors included in an IMU are the gyroscope, the accelerometer, and the magnetometer. Additionally, there are other sensors such as a barometer, a temperature sensor, a pressure sensor, or even an attitude sensor. The components that an IMU consists of are many and the main differences concern the technology they integrate, the designer purpose, and the specifications set by the manufacturer. The purpose of this review is a comparative presentation of 42 IMU models from 7 different manufacturers over the last five years comparing main features such as structure details, connectivity, and communication protocols. Moreover, statistical results are quantitatively and qualitatively presented providing a future user the possibility to select the proper IMU.},

	abstract = {Mobile robot path planning refers to the design of the safely collision-free path with shortest distance and least time-consuming from the starting point to the end point by a mobile robot autonomously. In this paper, a systematic review of mobile robot path planning techniques is presented. Firstly, path planning is classified into global path planning and local path planning according to the mastery of environmental information. In the global path planning, environment modeling methods and path evaluation method are introduced. The methods of environment modeling include grid method, topology method, geometric feature method and mixed representation method. In the local path planning, we introduce the sensors commonly used in the detection environment, including laser radar and visual sensor. Next, according to the characteristics of algorithms, mobile robot path planning algorithms are divided into three categories: classical algorithms, bionic algorithms and artificial intelligence algorithms. Among the classical algorithms, we introduce the cell decomposition method, sampling based method, graph search algorithm, artificial potential field method and dynamic window method. In the algorithm based on bionics, we introduce genetic algorithm, ant colony algorithm, gray wolf algorithm, etc. in detail. In artificial intelligence algorithm, we introduce neural network algorithm and fuzzy logic. Finally, we compare the key technologies of mobile robot path planning in the form of graphs and charts based on the classification statistics of the collected literature to provide references for future research.},

	abstract = {Robots are currently replacing humans in different tasks in various sectors. Among the vital features desirable in autonomous robots is the capability of navigating safely through a given environment. Robot navigation is a process designed with the ability of avoiding any hitches or obstacles while aiming at a specific predefined position. Many studies have been proposed to find solutions to robot path-planning problems. This paper presents a survey of the heuristic and classical path-planning approaches. Focal strengths, together with the weaknesses of these approaches, were also identified to provide deep insight for future studies. As several literature studies have recommended, classical methods might not be effective in real-time applications as a result of their failure to confront the unpredictable nature of the real-world. They require a considerable amount of computation and space, while heuristic-based methods can overcome real-world problems with some modifications. To summarize the research progress and also suggest future directions of path-planning research, this study performs a bibliometric analysis of the relevant publications published from 2000 to 2020. The results show that 5385 articles were published in 1128 journals, hence indicating publication diversity. There is a steady rise in the yearly publication output, reflecting an increase in global research interest in the topic. In general, this research provides useful insight into path-planning research so that researchers in this area can better recognize the relevant research study topics and search for the appropriate research partners.},

Composition is shown to achieve a high degree of performance optimization, particularly valuable for resource-constrained systems and sensor processing pipelines, enabling distributed tasks that would not be otherwise possible in ROS 2. In this work, we briefly introduce the significance and design of node composition, then our contribution of benchmarking is provided to analyze its impact on robotic systems.

The Robot Operating System (ROS) was an integral part of the last chapter, demonstrably expediting robotics research with freely available components and a modular framework.

ROS 2 and its related projects have been redesigned from the ground up to meet the challenges set forth by modern robotic systems in new and exploratory domains at all scales.

	abstract = {After decades of development, LIDAR and visual SLAM technology has relatively matured and been widely used in the military and civil fields. SLAM technology enables the mobile robot to have the abilities of autonomous positioning and mapping, which allows the robot to move in indoor and outdoor scenes where GPS signals are scarce. However, SLAM technology relying only on a single sensor has its limitations. For example, LIDAR SLAM is not suitable for scenes with highly dynamic or sparse features, and visual SLAM has poor robustness in low-texture or dark scenes. However, through the fusion of the two technologies, they have great potential to learn from each other. Therefore, this paper predicts that SLAM technology combining LIDAR and visual sensors, as well as various other sensors, will be the mainstream direction in the future. This paper reviews the development history of SLAM technology, deeply analyzes the hardware information of LIDAR and cameras, and presents some classical open source algorithms and datasets. According to the algorithm adopted by the fusion sensor, the traditional multi-sensor fusion methods based on uncertainty, features, and novel deep learning are introduced in detail. The excellent performance of the multi-sensor fusion method in complex scenes is summarized, and the future development of multi-sensor fusion method is prospected.},

	abstract = {Long-term operation of autonomous robots creates new challenges to the Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). Varying conditions of the vehicleâs surroundings, such as appearance variations (lighting, daytime, weather, or seasonal) or reconï¬gurations of the environment, are a challenge for SLAM algorithms to adapt to new changes while preserving old states. When also operating for long periods and trajectory lengths, the map should readjust to environment changes but not grow indeï¬nitely, where the map size should be dependent only on the explored environment area. Long-term SLAM intends to overcome the challenges associated with lifelong autonomy and improve the robustness of autonomous systems. Although several studies review SLAM algorithms, none of them focus on lifelong autonomy. Thus, this paper presents a systematic literature review on long-term localization and mapping following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. The review analyzes 142 works covering appearance invariance, modeling the environment dynamics, map size management, multi-session, and computational issues including parallel computing and timming eï¬ciency. The analysis also focus on the experimental data and evaluation metrics commonly used to assess long-term autonomy. Moreover, an overview over the bibliographic data of the 142 records provides analysis in terms of keywords and authorship co-occurrence to identify the terms more used in long-term SLAM and research networks between authors, respectively. Future studies can update this paper thanks to the systematic methodology presented in the review and the public GitHub repository with all the documentation and scripts used during the review process.},

	abstract = {LiDAR sensors are very popular for mapping and localisation with mobile robots, yet they cannot handle harsh environments, containing smoke, fog, dust, etc. On the other hand, radar sensors can overcome these situations, but they are not able to represent an environment in the same quality as a LiDAR due to their limited range and angular resolution. In the following article, we present further results regarding SLAM involving the mechanical pivoting radar (MPR), which is a 2D high bandwidth radar scanner that was introduced in Fritsche et al. (Radar and LiDAR sensor fusion in low visibility environments, 2016, [8]). We present two strategies for fusing MPR and LiDAR data to achieve SLAM in an environment with low visibility. The first approach is based on features and requires the presence of landmarks, which can be extracted with LiDAR and MPR. The second SLAM approach is based on scan registration and requires a scan fusion between the two sensors. In the end, we show our experiments, involving real fog, in order to demonstrate, how our approaches make SLAM possible in harsh environments.},
