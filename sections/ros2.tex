%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

% Overview
ROS2 was developed to provide modular and distributed systems, allowing much of the work to be reused and easily adapted to new and similar applications, facilitating collaboration and cooperation\:\cite{macenski_robot_2022}. It has real time capabilities and works on embedded systems as well as in diverse network conditions and environments\:\cite{macenski_robot_2022}.
% Features
% Sensor fusion
Among all of the the features offered by ROS2, one of them is sensor fusion, using either an extended Kalman filter (EKF) or an unscented Kalman filter (UKF)\:\cite{macenski_desks_2023}. 
% Localization
It also offers an AMCL (adaptive Monte Carlo localization) package for localization\:\cite{macenski_desks_2023}. 
% Utility functions
Additionally, ROS2 offers a number of utility functions to improve safety by giving commands, regulating and validating the robotic system and its navigation\:\cite{macenski_desks_2023}. Included in these are collision monitoring which overrides the navigation planner in case of emergencies, and lifecycle manger which ensures that the system starts up and shuts down in a safe and deterministic manner\:\cite{macenski_desks_2023}.
